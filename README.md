# 08 TypeScript and OOP: Vehicle Builder

## Overview
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application built using TypeScript and Inquirer.js. The system allows users to manage and interact with different types of vehicles, including Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes. Each vehicle type has its own properties and specific behaviors. For instance, Trucks can tow other vehicles, and Motorbikes can perform wheelies.

The CLI system allows users to:

Create new vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Motorbikes).
Choose from existing vehicles.
Perform various actions on the vehicles, such as starting, accelerating, turning, reversing, and stopping.
Additional specialized actions for specific vehicles (e.g., towing for trucks, wheelies for motorbikes).

### User Story

```md
AS a developer
I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.
```

## Features
Create Vehicles: Users can create Cars, Trucks, or Motorbikes by specifying attributes like color, make, model, year, weight, top speed, and more.
Perform Actions on Vehicles: Users can select a vehicle and perform actions like:
Start the vehicle.
Accelerate or decelerate.
Turn left or right.
Stop and reverse.
Perform specific actions like towing for trucks or wheelies for motorbikes.
Vehicle Management: The system allows managing multiple vehicles at once, storing them in a list and performing operations on any selected vehicle.

## Available Commands
Once the application starts, you will be prompted to either:

Create a new vehicle (Car, Truck, Motorbike)
Select an existing vehicle to perform actions on
You can then interact with the vehicle through a series of commands, such as:

Start
Accelerate
Decelerate
Stop
Turn (left or right)
Reverse
Tow (for trucks)
Do a wheelie (for motorbikes)
Example
Here's a quick example of creating a car and performing some actions:

Create a car with a random VIN and specify attributes like make, model, year, etc.
Start the car.
Accelerate the car by 5 MPH.
Turn the car left.
Stop the car.
